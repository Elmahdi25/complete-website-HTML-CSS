# complete-website-HTML-CSS
In developing the frontend phase for this website, I practiced various tools of HTML and CSS, implementing concepts such as color management to ensure a comfortable viewing experience, proper sizing of elements, and maintaining adequate spacing between content. Additionally, I ensured responsiveness using media queries for screens under 770px. I also employed some JavaScript logic to create a responsive navbar; upon clicking, it transforms into a hamburger menu, displaying seven sections: 'Home,' 'About Us,' 'Features,' 'Courses,' 'Offers,' and 'Contact.' Finally, I completed the layout with a simple footer.
